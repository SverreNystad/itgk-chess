# CLI Chess
This was one of my  first python programs. It is very bad, but I am proud of how bad it was as it shows me how much I have improved 

## Usage
To run this chess implementation, navigate to the project's root directory in your command line interface and execute the following command:
```bash
python chess_vf.py
```
